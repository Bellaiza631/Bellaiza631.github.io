Project brief review
This is merely a copy of the original project brief as presented to you during the UX challenge. It is provided for review.

The concept of public transit trackers isnâ€™t new but it does offer up a wealth of opportunities to work with imperfect data 
that is incredibly important to the users of a given app or service. Few things will make people run faster than discovering 
their bus is a mere 2 minutes away from the bus stop.

In this exercise you are tasked with helping create a mobile app called BusyBus, an application operated by the local city 
transit system that is serves thousands of commuters in a large city near you.

Transit officials have identified a problem they would like to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently 
added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time 
they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be 
the bus the rider is expecting.

Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the 
stop.
